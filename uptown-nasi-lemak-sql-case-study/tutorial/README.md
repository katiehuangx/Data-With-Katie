# Tutorial 

This tutorial is a gentle introduction to SQL using a fun, real-world dataset inspired by a local Malaysian favourite: *Village Park Nasi Lemak*. 

*(I'm Malaysian üá≤üáæ and I love Village Park's nasi lemak with crispy fried chicken or what we call "ayam goreng" in Malay.)*

The exercises are arranged in increasing difficulty. We'll start with basic queries (**counting rows, selecting unique values**) and gradually move into more advanced problems (**joins, aggregations, and window functions**). 

Each question comes with a short explanation of the concept it teaches, so you can practice and build confidence step by step. üòâ

## üå± Beginner (Level 1‚Äì3)

### 1. How many total orders were made?

We‚Äôre simply counting all the rows in the `sales` table since each row represents one order. 

- **Step 1:** Identify the table where the data is from ‚Üí `uptown_nasi_lemak.sales`.

</p>

*(Link to Entity Relationship (ER) diagram: [here](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Data-With-Katie/blob/main/uptown-nasi-lemak-sql-case-study/assets/erd.png))*

- **Step 2:** Use `COUNT(*)` or `COUNT(order_id)` to count the rows. 
- **Step 3:** Give the result a meaningful column name `AS sales_count`.

<details> 
<summary> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Show solution üí° (click to expand) </summary>

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS sales_count
FROM uptown_nasi_lemak.sales;
```

‚úÖ Expected result: 36
</details>


### 2. What are the names of all menu items available?

We want to list all the menu items sold. Since duplicates don‚Äôt add value here, we use `DISTINCT` so each food name shows only once.  

- **Step 1:** Identify table where menu items are stored ‚Üí `uptown_nasi_lemak.menu`.  
- **Step 2:** Apply `DISTINCT` on `food_name` to remove duplicates.

<details> 
<summary> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Show solution </summary>

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT food_name
FROM uptown_nasi_lemak.menu;
```

‚úÖ Expected result: 
| food_name              |
| ---------------------- |
| Nasi Lemak Ayam Goreng |
| Nasi Lemak Sotong      |
| Nasi Lemak Telur Mata  |

</details>


### 3. What is the total number of unique customers?

We‚Äôre finding how many different customers placed an order. That means counting distinct `customer_id`s rather than rows.

- **Step 1:** Identify table with customer IDs ‚Üí `uptown_nasi_lemak.sales`.
- **Step 2:** Use `COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)` to count unique values.

<details> 
<summary> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Show solution </summary>

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count
FROM uptown_nasi_lemak.sales;
```

‚úÖ Expected result: 10
</details>

## üçú Intermediate (Level 4‚Äì6)

### 4. How many times was each dish ordered?  
We want to see the popularity of each menu item. To do that, we group by dish name and count how many times it was ordered.  

üí° **Tip:** It might feel easier to group by `food_id` and just output IDs. But in real-world reporting, IDs aren‚Äôt meaningful to business users. Showing the actual **dish names** makes the output clearer and more useful.  

- **Step 1:** Identify the tables needed ‚Üí `uptown_nasi_lemak.sales` and `uptown_nasi_lemak.menu`.  
- **Step 2:** Join them on `food_id` to match orders with dish names.  
- **Step 3:** Use `COUNT(order_id)` grouped by `food_name` to find the number of times each dish was ordered.  
- **Step 4:** Sort the results in ascending order by the count.  

<details> 
<summary> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Show solution </summary>

```sql
SELECT 
	menu.food_name,
  COUNT(sales.order_id) AS no_of_dish_ordered
FROM uptown_nasi_lemak.sales AS sales
INNER JOIN uptown_nasi_lemak.menu AS menu
	ON sales.food_id = menu.food_id
GROUP BY menu.food_name
ORDER BY no_of_dish_ordered ASC;
```

‚úÖ Expected result:
| food_name | no_of_dish_ordered | 
| ---------------------- | --------------- | 
| Nasi Lemak Ayam Goreng | 11 | 
| Nasi Lemak Sotong | 12 | 
| Nasi Lemak Telur Mata | 13 |

</details>

### 5. What is the total revenue made by the restaurant?
Join sales with menu and sum the price.

<details> 
<summary> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Show solution üí°</summary>

```sql
SELECT SUM(menu.price) AS revenue
FROM uptown_nasi_lemak.sales AS sales
INNER JOIN uptown_nasi_lemak.menu AS menu
	ON sales.food_id = menu.food_id;
```

‚úÖ Expected result: 10
</details>

### 6. What is the total number of orders from each order channel? 

Join sales with order_channels and group by channel.

<details> 
<summary> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Show solution üí°</summary>

```sql
SELECT 
  channels.channel_name,
	COUNT(sales.order_id) AS no_of_orders
FROM uptown_nasi_lemak.sales AS sales
INNER JOIN uptown_nasi_lemak.order_channels AS channels
	ON sales.channel_id = channels.channel_id
GROUP BY channels.channel_name
ORDER BY no_of_orders ASC;
```

‚úÖ Expected result:  
| channel_name | no_of_orders |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| GrabFood     | 10           |
| Takeaway     | 11           |
| Dine-In      | 15           |

INNER JOIN uptown_nasi_lemak.menu AS menu
	ON sales.food_id = menu.food_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
