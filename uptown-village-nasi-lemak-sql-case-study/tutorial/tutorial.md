# üìù SQL Tutorial 

This tutorial is an introduction to SQL using a fun dataset inspired by a local Malaysian favourite: *Village Park Nasi Lemak üçöüå∂Ô∏èüêî*. 

*(I'm Malaysian üá≤üáæ and I love Village Park's nasi lemak with crispy fried chicken üçó or what we call "ayam goreng" in Malay.)*

The tutorial questions are arranged in increasing difficulty ‚¨ÜÔ∏è. We'll start with basics (**counting rows, selecting unique values and summing totals**) and gradually move into more advanced concepts (**joins, HAVING and CTEs**). 

Each question comes with a short explanation of the concept it teaches, so you can practice and build confidence step by step. üòâ

## üå± SQL Tutorial (Level 1‚Äì3)

### 1. How many total orders were made?

We‚Äôre simply counting all the rows in the `orders` table since each row represents one order. 

üí° **Key Takeaway:** Overall sales volume is one of the first metrics leadership looks at to measure store performance at a glance.

- **Step 1:** Identify the table where the data is from ‚Üí `uptown_nasi_lemak.orders`. 
- **Step 2:** Use `COUNT(*)` or `COUNT(order_id)` to count the rows. 
- **Step 3:** Give the result a meaningful column name `AS total_orders_count`.

<details> 
<summary> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Show solution</summary>

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders_count
FROM uptown_nasi_lemak.orders;
```

‚úÖ Expected result:
| **total_orders_count** |
|------------------------|
| 300                    |

</details>

### 2. Retrieve the food_name and price for each menu item. (Beginner)

<details> 
<summary> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Show solution</summary>

```sql
SELECT 
  food_name, 
  unit_price
FROM uptown_nasi_lemak.menu;
```

‚úÖ Expected result: 
| **food_name**                                                      | **unit_price** |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Nasi Lemak Ayam Goreng (Fried Chicken Nasi Lemak)                  | 12.00          |
| Nasi Lemak Sotong (Squid Sambal Nasi Lemak)                        | 14.50          |
| Nasi Lemak Telur Mata (Egg Nasi Lemak)                             | 7.50           |
| Teh Tarik (Pulled Milk Tea)                                        | 3.50           |
| Sambal Sotong Extra (Spicy Squid Sambal)                           | 6.50           |
| Fried Chicken Wing                                                 | 5.00           |
| Roti Bakar Butter & Kaya (Toasted Bread with Butter & Coconut Jam) | 3.20           |
| Telur Separuh Masak (Half-Boiled Eggs)                             | 2.50           |
| Milo Ais (Iced Chocolate Malt Drink)                               | 4.50           |
| Sirap Bandung (Rose Syrup with Milk)                               | 4.00           |

</details>


### 3. What is the total number of unique customers?

We‚Äôre finding how many different customers placed an order. That means counting distinct `customer_id`s rather than rows.

- **Step 1:** Identify table with customer IDs ‚Üí `uptown_nasi_lemak.orders`.
- **Step 2:** Use `COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)` to count unique values.

<details> 
<summary> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Show solution</summary>

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers_count
FROM uptown_nasi_lemak.orders;
```

‚úÖ Expected result:
| **unique_customers_count** |
|----------------------------|
| 50                         |

</details>

---

## üõë Intermediate (Level 4‚Äì6)

### 4. How many times was each dish ordered? Sort results in ascending order by the count. 
We want to see the popularity of each menu item. 

üìå **Business Note:** It might feel easier to group by `food_id` and output IDs, but in real-world reporting, IDs aren‚Äôt meaningful to business users. Showing the **actual dish names** makes the output presentation-ready, clearer, and more useful when sharing results with management.

- **Step 1:** Join the `uptown_nasi_lemak.orders` and `uptown_nasi_lemak.menu` to match orders with dish names.  
- **Step 2:** Use `COUNT(order_id)` grouped by `food_name` to find the number of times each dish was ordered.  
- **Step 3:** Sort the results in ascending order by the count.  

<details> 
<summary> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Show solution</summary>

```sql
SELECT 
	menu.food_name,
  COUNT(orders.order_id) AS no_of_dish_ordered
FROM uptown_nasi_lemak.orders AS orders
INNER JOIN uptown_nasi_lemak.menu AS menu
	ON orders.food_id = menu.food_id
GROUP BY menu.food_name
ORDER BY no_of_dish_ordered ASC;
```

‚úÖ Expected result:
| **food_name**                                     | **no_of_dish_ordered** |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Fried Chicken Wing                                | 47                     |
| Teh Tarik (Pulled Milk Tea)                       | 48                     |
| Sambal Sotong Extra (Spicy Squid Sambal)          | 48                     |
| Nasi Lemak Telur Mata (Egg Nasi Lemak)            | 51                     |
| Nasi Lemak Sotong (Squid Sambal Nasi Lemak)       | 53                     |
| Nasi Lemak Ayam Goreng (Fried Chicken Nasi Lemak) | 53                     |

</details>

### 5. What is the total revenue made by the restaurant?

üìå **Business Note:** Revenue tracking is the foundation of every financial report and is typically the first metric reviewed in monthly Profit & Loss.

- **Step 1:** Use the `uptown_nasi_lemak.orders` table to retrieve the order quantity and unit price of food.
- **Step 2:** Mutiply `quantity` and `unit_price` then apply `SUM` to add up revenue from all rows.

<details> 
<summary> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Show solution</summary>

```sql
SELECT SUM(quantity * unit_price) AS total_revenue
FROM uptown_nasi_lemak.orders
```

‚úÖ Expected result:
| **total_revenue** |
|-------------------|
| 3894.30           |

</details>

### 6. What is the total number of orders from each order channel? Sort results by the highest number of orders.

We want to know how many orders came from Dine-In, Takeaway, and GrabFood. 

- **Step 1:** Join `uptown_nasi_lemak.orders` with `uptown_nasi_lemak.order_channels` using `channel_id`.
- **Step 2:** Count how many `order_id` values appear for each channel.
- **Step 3:** Group by `channel_name` and sort results.

üìå **Business Note:** Splitting by channel helps businesses evaluate the ROI of delivery partnerships and optimize staff allocation across delivery vs. dine-in vs. takeaway.

<details> 
<summary> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Show solution</summary>

```sql
SELECT 
  channels.channel_name,
	COUNT(orders.order_id) AS no_of_orders
FROM uptown_nasi_lemak.orders AS orders
INNER JOIN uptown_nasi_lemak.order_channels AS channels
	ON orders.channel_id = channels.channel_id
GROUP BY channels.channel_name
ORDER BY no_of_orders DESC;
```

‚úÖ Expected result:  
| **channel_name** | **no_of_orders** |
|------------------|------------------|
| Dine-In          | 108              |
| Takeaway         | 100              |
| GrabFood         | 92               |
